# Awesome Todo
 The Awesome Todo app is being developed by me as a way to learn how to use the Quasar framework. I'm following [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAiDzIdBfy8iu_MZrq3IPuSFcRgCQ0iL0) course by Danny Connell in order to develop it. Some tweaks were necessary as the course is from 2019 and the framework had upgrades since.
